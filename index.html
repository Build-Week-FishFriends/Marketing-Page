          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>
            Have you ever been vacationing somewhere and wanted to get away from
            it all and fish but don't know where to go? We've got you covered!
            Just create a free profile and you will be able to see all of the
            fishing spots in your area! You can see what fish have been caught
            there using what lures and over how much time. When you're done
            fishing upload your own fishing data to the fishing spot to help
            others. You'll also be able to view all of your past uploads incase
            you forget where you caught that trophy fish.

            "When I was on a business trip and had some downtime I wanted to go
            fishing but I wasn't familiar with the area. That's when I found
            Fish Friends! It was so easy to use, I was able to find a spot
            quickly and get fishing fast."

            "My buddy and I were trying to plan a fishing roadtrip but other
            sites were so clunky it was discouraging! Fish Friends saved our
            roadtrip! Thanks for making a great site!"
